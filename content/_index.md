Toroidal helps you host webrings from your static site. With the Toroidal module installed, all you
need to do is add a few pages to your site, define metadata for the webring members, and that's it.

Members can then add the webring navigation to their own site as either an iframe as a
zero-configuration option or copy-paste an HTML snippet if they want more control over the way the
webring is styled on their site.

Toroidal is inspired by [TooManyBees/ring](https://toomanybees.github.io/ring/about).
