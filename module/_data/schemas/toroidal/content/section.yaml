    Defines optional settings for the Toroidal module on a section (`_index.md`) page using values
    in the page's front matter.

    This is largely only useful for defining defaults for the webring through Hugo's [`cascade`][01]
    feature, allowing you to define the values once at the section level and override or extend
    them for members as needed.

            `Webring` is used.

            This setting overrides the [`toroidal.webring_name`][s01] in the site's
