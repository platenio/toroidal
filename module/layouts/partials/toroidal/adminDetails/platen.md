This page includes some useful information for members to grab for setting up webring navigation on
their own sites.

Each member has their own section with actionable links and embed code for both literals and
iframes. The links section includes the configured link to their homepage and a link to the markdown
source for the host's site repository where their entry can be edited.

The HTML sections include the code snippet for that type of embed and buttons they can click to copy
the code onto their clipboard. The displayed code snippet includes comments that explain what the
code does and why. It's up to each member whether they want to embed the webring in their site as a
literal or an iframe and if they want to include the comments or not.

The iframe embed is the simplest way to get the webring navigation up and running on a member site.
Copy the snippet, paste it where you want it, done. However, an iframe is much less configurable and
stylable. You get the page as it appears on the host.

The literal embed requires more work but is much more flexible. It gives a member the full source of
the navigation menu for the webring alongside a script to pull the latest data from the webring
host. This gives a member full control over where and how the navigation is displayed but doesn't
provide any default styling for them.

Regardless of whether a member chooses the iframe or literal embed, unless the host changes their
hosting URL or the member's site name, members should not have to update their embedded code very
often, if ever.

For members that are also [Platen][01] sites, they have one further option, which is copy a partial
that they can use to add the webring navigation directly to their site menu.
