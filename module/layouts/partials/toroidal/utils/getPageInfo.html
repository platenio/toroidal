  This partial expects to receive the context for a page whose type is toroidal
  and returns a scratch with the following values:

  - `webringName`: The calculated name of the webring this page belongs to.
  - `memberListHref`: The URL to the page on the host site which lists all of
     the members of the webring and where the `Member List` link in the
     generated nav takes a user.
  - `memberPages`: The list of page contexts for this webring's members.
  - `memberPageLinks`: The list of home page URLs for this webring's members.
  - `webringApiUrl`: The URL to the JSON blob on the host site which includes
     all of the information needed to understand/interact with this webring.
  - `prevHref`: The URL to the previous member's homepage in this webring.
  - `nextHref`: The URL to the next member's homepage in this webring.
  - `styles`: The link element for the calculated SCSS for this member page.
  - `hideHeader`: Whether or not this member page should display the webring's
    name as a header tag; this must be explicitly set by the user in the page
    frontmatter or the header will be displayed.
  - `randomMemberLink`: Whether or not this member page should include the random
     member link in the navigation; this must be explicitly set by the site's
     owner in the site configuration or this will not be displayed.
  - `memberName`: The name of this member of the webring.

    defines an override.
