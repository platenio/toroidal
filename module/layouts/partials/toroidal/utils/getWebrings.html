  This partial looks over the entire site for toroidal sections and then adds
  each discovered section with 1+ defined/functional member to the list of
  webrings. For each of those sections it also looks for child sections with
  members, adding those too.

  In this implementation, only one level of nesting is supported. It is not
  recursive. It only looks inside top-level sections which are defined with
  the toroidal type.
