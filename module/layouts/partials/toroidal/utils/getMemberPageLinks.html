{{/*
  This partial expects to receive the context for a page whose type is toroidal
  and discovers all of the member sites in the same webring, returning their
  homepage URLs as a slice of strings.

  It does so by:
  
  1. Checking the page's parent for all the regular (i.e. non-section) pages
     which have configured their homepage to a non-empty string; any page
     without this set properly must be ignored so links don't break.
  2. Looping over those discovered pages, appending their defined home page
     URL to the slice.
  3. Returning the slice.
