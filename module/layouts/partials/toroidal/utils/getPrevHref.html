{{/*
  Expects a dict with `context` for the current page and `MemberPages` for the
  list of webring member entries in the site. It determines and returns the
  link for the previous page in the webring by:

  1. Checking for the next page in the section; because the weighting in hugo
     orders things in reverse from the naive expectation of a user (i.e. the
     higher weight is "previous" instead of "next"), we have to invert the
     logic even though we want the _previous_ page weight from the list.
  2. If the href can't be determined from the previous step, filter the list
     of member pages to exclude this page and set the href to the home page
     url of the last item in that filtered slice.
